// COMMENT SECTION

// add functionality so that comments will be posted to the page when the user submits the form

// Add an event listener to the form, listening for submission

// capture user inputs (name, email, text) and assign them to variables
// create an html element that will hold the input, matching the comments already on the page ( div.comment-card )
// add the child elements to the comment-card (img, div.comment-content>p.commenter+p) assign them IDs as well

// add the user inputs to the elements - how? object literals, text nodes, text content, inner text??


// append the div as a child to section.comments
// clear the form
